    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use LangChain and OpenAI's ChatGPT API to build a chatbot that can answer questions using information from a set of source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework for building apps using language models. There are many off-the-shelf chains - sequences of calls to components, including other chains - that make it easy to get something going really quickly.\n",

    "#### Part 1: Chatbot Interface\n",
    "First let's build the interface using Gradio and get the skeleton of the chatbot in place. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, we will use `send_chat_message()` to simulate the chatbot's responses."

    "3. **Storage**: Storage (e.g., often a vectorstore) will house and often embed the chunks\n",

    "1. Using the chat history and the new question to create a ‚Äústandalone question‚Äù: This way, the question can be passed into the retrieval step to fetch relevant documents. For eg., consider a follow-up question like \"Where can I find it?\". If only the new question was passed in, then language model would have no idea what 'it' is. If the whole conversation was passed in, there may be unnecessary information that would distract from retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Retrieving relevant documents using this new question.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Obtaining the final response: The retrieved documents are passed to an LLM along with the new question and it uses them to generate an answer."
